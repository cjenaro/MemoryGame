# Memory Game!

This is my own version of the memory game made for Udacity's JavaScript nanodegree.

This is the project's [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/591/view) and this are the [instructions](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd001/parts/8d8cb0aa-ec2b-4e20-b961-85fb324b6787/modules/d23c2328-c79f-4e9e-92d3-6362724392a6/lessons/f5911397-4fba-4a30-ab40-3447cc6b2b90/concepts/b98425f0-10b1-4fa4-9fce-174767c240b6)

## Images

All the images used where downloaded from:

https://getemoji.com/ (emojis for the cards and restart button)

https://icons8.com/ (stars for the rating)

## Comments
The game was overall pretty easy to make but it was still very fun, animations where a little bit of a pain.

## Open Game

To open the game you need to clone the github repo and simply open index.html with any browser.

## Playing the Game

Just click in any card to flip it! If the two images match the cards stay flipped, otherwise they go back to the starting position

## Dependencies

For this project I am not using any dependencies, just my own CSS, HTML and JavaScript
